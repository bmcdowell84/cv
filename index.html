            I am a Field Service Technician in an IT department for a major airport. In my spare time, I
            continue to learn new subjects; I am currently filling out my portfolio with several programming languages.
            Before this, I was a Radar Technician in the United States Navy and a Subsea Technician for offshore
            drilling, specializing in blowout preventers.
